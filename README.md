Hey there 👋

I'm Rushan, a Computer Science undergraduate studying at IIT Sri Lanka (University of Westminster).

My main focus is full-stack web development using the MERN stack.  
I’ve learned React, Node.js, and TypeScript, and I’m currently expanding my knowledge in the rest of the MERN ecosystem.

I also have a foundation in Java and Object-Oriented Programming, which helps me write structured and maintainable code.

This GitHub is where I upload coursework, personal projects, experiments, and things I’m currently learning.  
Most projects are built from scratch as part of my learning journey.
